# 42 group project - minishell

## Our first little bash in C!

This project's purpose is to create a simple shell.

We have to reproduce bash posix behaviour and features such as a working command history, a lot of syntax error handling, an efficient implementation of pipes and redirections to execute several commands, and a small list of builtins like ``echo``, ``export`` or ``cd`` for exemple.
### How to run the program 

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shikalou/minishell.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd minishell/
```
MAKE
```bash
  make
```
Start the program
```bash
  ./minishell
```

Now you can use this as your own little bash !
